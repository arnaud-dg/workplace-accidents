# Workplace Accidents Analyzer

This project analyzes workplace accidents using data from the EPICEA database managed by INRS (Institut National de Recherche et de Sécurité). It includes a Jupyter notebook for data processing and analysis, as well as a Power BI dashboard for visualizing the results.

## Features

- Data extraction from the EPICEA database
- Text analysis of accident descriptions using Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Statistical analysis of workplace accidents
- Interactive Power BI dashboard for data visualization

## Jupyter Notebook

The main analysis is conducted in a Jupyter notebook. Key components include:

- Data collection from the INRS website
- Extraction of structured information from unstructured accident descriptions using LLMs
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis of accidents
